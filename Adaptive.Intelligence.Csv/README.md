Adaptive Intelligence .NET CSV Import / Export Library
=======================================

Provides a basic mechanism for reading, writing, and manipulating CSV files, using the main three (3) classes, CsvFile, 
CsvReader, and CsvWriter.  Supports generic type data via reflection, and ordering using the IndexAttribute class.  

Next expected update will include DataTable support.
